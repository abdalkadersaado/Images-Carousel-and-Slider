            <h2>Birds</h2>
            <p>
              Birds are vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves,
              characterized by feathers, a beak with no teeth, and laying
              hard-shelled eggs. They are found in a wide range of habitats
              worldwide and are known for their ability to fly (although not all
              birds can fly).

            <p>
              Elephants are large mammals belonging to the family Elephantidae,
              which includes three species: the African bush elephant, the
              African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are known
              for their distinct features such as their large ears, long trunks,
              tusks, and significant size.

            <p>
              Mountains are prominent landforms that rise significantly above
              the surrounding terrain, usually characterized by steep slopes and
              significant height differences. They are formed through various
              geological processes and can be found on every continent

            <p>
              Seas are large bodies of saltwater that are smaller than oceans
              and are usually partially enclosed by land. They are integral
              parts of the Earth's hydrosphere and play a crucial role in
              climate regulation, biodiversity, and human activities.
